Gross Reproduction Rate (Per Female):
Data prior to 1980 pertain to total population.  Data from 1980 onwards pertain to resident population (i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents).  
Net Reproduction Rate (Per Female):
Data prior to 1980 pertain to total population.  Data from 1980 onwards pertain to resident population (i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents).  
Crude Birth Rate (Per Thousand Residents):
Data prior to 1980 pertain to total population.  Data from 1980 onwards pertain to resident population (i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents).
Total Live-Births (Number):
Data are based on date of occurrence.
Resident Live-Births (Number):
Refers to births with at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident.  Data for 1980-1985 are estimated.  Data are based on date of occurrence.
Citizen Live-Births (Number):
Refers to births with at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen. Data are based on date of occurrence.

Crude Birth Rate:
Crude birth rate (CBR) refers to the number of live-births to the population in the year per thousand population.
Gross Reproduction Rate:
"Gross reproduction rate refers to the average number of daughters a woman would have over her lifetime, under the assumptions that (i) she experiences the age-specific fertility rates prevailing during the reference period and (ii) she survives to the end of her childbearing years."
Live-Births:
Data refer to all live births occurring within Singapore and its territorial waters as registered under the prevailing Registration of Births and Deaths Act in force at the material time.
Net Reproduction Rate:
"Net reproduction rate (NRR) is a refinement of the Gross reproduction rate (GRR), and is a measure of replacement of population. It refers to the average number of daughters a woman would have over her lifetime, under the assumptions that she experiences (i) the age-specific fertility rate and (ii) the age-specific mortality rate prevailing during the reference period. To achieve population replacement, the NRR should be at least 1.0. This means that on average, each woman gives birth to at least one daughter who survives to reproductive age, ensuring that the female population is replaced from one generation to the next."
Total Fertility Rate:
"Total fertility rate refers to the average number of live-births each female would have during her reproductive years if she were subject to the prevailing age-specific fertility rates in the population in the given year. Age-specific fertility rate refers to the number of live-births born to females of a specific age group, out of every thousand females in the same age group."
